# What?

Rereql connects [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) queries to
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components via
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

# Status

Rereql is now functional, see the [example](./examples/query-and-mutate).

Please use experimentally, would love feedback.

# Documentation

See the [commented example](./examples/query-and-mutate/src/index.js).

You can run the example locally:

```
cd ./examples/query-and-mutate
npm install
npm start
```

However, as there is no server, it will error out for now...
