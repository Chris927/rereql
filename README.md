# What?

Rereql connects [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) queries to
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) components via
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

# Status

Rereql is now functional, see the [example](./examples/query-and-mutate).

Connecting components to queries looks good and ready, but mutations are
probably more cumbersome than necessary; I'll re-work the API for the latter.

Please use experimentally, would love feedback.
